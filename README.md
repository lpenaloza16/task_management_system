# Testing Task Management System App with React and Zustand

Currently, I'm testing out a task management app using React and Zustand. I'm updating the markup file to make sure everything's set up correctly for the project.

## React + Vite

I'm checking out two plugins:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md), which uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc), which uses SWC for Fast Refresh.

These plugins help keep things running smoothly as I explore what the task management app can do.
